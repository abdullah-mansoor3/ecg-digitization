Step 1: Preprocessing
Techniques: CLAHE, denoising, grayscale conversion

Purpose: Enhance ECG trace visibility and reduce noise before detection or segmentation

Step 2: Lead and Region Detection
Model: YOLOv8 (object detection)

Input: Full ECG paper image

Output: Cropped images of each lead, metadata, calibration segment

Purpose: Isolate individual ECG leads for separate processing and clean signal extraction

Step 3: Perspective Correction
Techniques: Hough Transform (for big box), corner detection, cv2.getPerspectiveTransform

Purpose: Remove skew/tilt so that pixel distances are uniform across the image for accurate time-voltage calibration

Step 4: Trace Segmentation
Model: U-Net (segmentation)

Input: Single-lead cropped image

Output: Binary mask (1 = waveform, 0 = background/grid)

Purpose: Separate ECG signal from dotted grid and noise for clean digitization

Step 5: Grid Analysis and Calibration
Techniques: Blob detection (for dots), clustering, spacing analysis

Purpose: Calculate pixel-to-time (s/pixel) and pixel-to-voltage (mV/pixel) scaling using spacing between small grid dots

Step 6: Digitization (1D Signal Extraction)
Techniques: Column-wise vertical scanning on binary mask

Purpose: Convert 2D trace into a time-series signal by mapping each column’s trace position to voltage using grid calibration

Optional: GAN-Based Digitization
Model: Pix2Pix (conditional GAN)

Purpose: Learn direct image-to-waveform mapping as an alternative to scanning + calibration for higher robustness

Output
Clean 1D digital ECG signals (CSV/NumPy), stored for further analysis, plotting, or classification
