# ECG Digitization

## Description

This project is aimed at digitizing the singals of 12 leads on an ecg paper and then predict myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) from it.

## Project Structure

  - [lead-segmentation](lead-segmentation) : Code to Fine-Tune YOLO v11s to detect and segment the 12 leads
  - [notebooks](./notebooks) : Notebooks for EDA, pre-processing etc
